# House Price Detection

# Overview
The "House Price Detection" project is a machine learning project aimed at predicting house prices based on a set of features and data attributes. The project leverages various machine learning algorithms and techniques to build a predictive model that estimates house prices accurately.

# Features
* # Data Exploration:
  In-depth exploration of the dataset, including statistical analysis and visualization, to gain insights into the housing market.

* # Data Preprocessing:
  Comprehensive data preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, feature engineering, and data scaling, to prepare the data for modeling.

* # Machine Learning Models:
  Utilization of multiple machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting, to build predictive models.

* # Model Evaluation:
  Rigorous model evaluation using appropriate metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared, to assess model performance.

* # Hyperparameter Tuning:
  Optimization of model hyperparameters to improve predictive accuracy and robustness.

* # Deployment:
  Deployment of the trained model using Flask to create a web application for real-time house price predictions.

* # User Interface:
  A user-friendly web interface that allows users to input property features and receive instant price estimates.

* # Documentation:
  Comprehensive documentation covering project details, data sources, methodology, and usage instructions.
